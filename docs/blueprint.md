- Frontend Pages: Implement Login, Signup, Create Blog, Blog List, Blog Detail, and Edit/Delete Blog pages. Employ form validation and conditional rendering based on user authentication status.
- Route Protection: Protect authenticated routes using React route guards, ensuring that unauthorized access is properly denied with informative error messages or redirects.
- Pagination & Blog Listing: Display blogs in a paginated list, optimizing load times and improving user experience. Include intuitive navigation buttons for moving between pages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of sophistication and depth. This color conveys intellect and thoughtfulness.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF) for a calming, neutral backdrop that allows the indigo to stand out. A very desaturated tint of the primary hue will keep the design harmonious.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF) is chosen as it sits adjacently to indigo on the color wheel, creating an analogous color scheme. Its brightness and saturation contrasts attractively with the primary color.
- Maintain a clean and professional aesthetic by using system fonts throughout the application for headers and body text.
- Design a mobile-first, responsive layout that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience across all devices.
- Incorporate a set of minimalist icons for navigation and actions to enhance usability and add a subtle visual appeal.
